## **Key Features of Your Bot**
Your bot has a well-structured flow designed to guide new users, reward existing ones, and provide useful resources. The main components are:
1. Onboarding and User Guidance
The bot's initial interaction is a clear onboarding process. When a user starts the bot, it verifies if they've registered on the Bots.Business platform. Through a series of commands like /Yes, /No, /YesX, and /YesZ, the bot provides a visual, step-by-step tutorial using images and inline keyboards. This helps new users understand how to log in, get their bot token from BotFather, and create their very first command within the Bots.Business app. This proactive guidance significantly lowers the barrier to entry for new developers.
## 2. Referral and Point System

A core aspect of your bot is its robust referral system. It encourages users to invite others by offering points for each successful referral. The code handles all the necessary logic:
Tracking Referrals: It uses RefLib to track who attracted whom.
Rewarding Users: When a referred user starts the bot, their referrer automatically receives points.
Leaderboards: The bot features a /myrefers command to show a user their personal referral count and a /toplist command to display the top 10 referrers globally, which creates a competitive and engaging element.
## 3. Educational Resources and Quizzes

The bot serves as an educational tool for learning Bots.Business scripting (BJS). It has a command, üòçLearn, that provides a "cheat sheet" of essential BJS code snippets, covering everything from sending messages to making HTTP requests. To test this knowledge, the bot includes a quiz system (/quiz, /quizCorrect, /quizWrong) that rewards users with points for correct answers, making the learning process interactive and fun.
## 4. Practical Code Snippets

The Referal Bonous /xyz123 command is an excellent way to give back to the user base. It randomly provides a copyable, pre-made BJS code snippet for practical tasks like uploading images to Telegraph, accepting Paytm payments, or creating an advanced rating system. This not only rewards users but also gives them valuable tools they can immediately implement in their own bots.
## 5. Support and Information

Your bot also acts as a central hub for essential Bots.Business information. The üõëSupport and ü§ñAi commands provide users with quick links to the platform's status page, main app, official help guides, and even a custom AI assistant built on GPT, which offers another layer of support for coding questions.
In summary, you've built a comprehensive, user-friendly bot that skillfully blends education, community-building, and practical utility.
